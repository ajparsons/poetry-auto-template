# GitHub Python poetry project template

## How to use

This GitHub template repository can be used to create a new repository with the skeleton of a Python library, based [on a python poetry-based template](https://github.com/ajparsons/cookie-python).

Start here: https://github.com/ajparsons/poetry-auto-template/generate

The name of your repository will be the name of the Python package that you publish to PyPI, so make sure that name is not taken already!

Add a one-line description of your repository, then click "Create repository from template".

See the [cookiecutter version of this template](https://github.com/ajparsons/cookie-python) for more details of the default settings and features of this template.

This approach is based on simonw's [python-lib-template-repository](https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository). This version does effectively the same things, but has a different set of default tools and configurations.
